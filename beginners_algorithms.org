- demo algorithmic complexity
- sparse matrices?
- simple parallel operation
- mention parallel computing

* IO and Viz (provide dataset); matplotlib, mayavi2
** IO
- hdf5 io, perhaps savez too
- genfromtxt but warn against its use
- memmap
** mayavi
- pylab 2D from numpy array (or hdf5 ds)
- hdf5 ds contour plot
- streamlines
- ???
*** More examples
[[http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/examples.html][mayavi examples page]]
* Game of Life
* Optimisation
* 3D linear PDE using FD, boundary value problem
   - explain nonlin in lectures
   - have them code a linear one
   - Krylov?
* Statistics
   - of a dataset
   - correlation functions? (FFT)
   - principal component analysis?
* MCMC

* Non-linear PDE?
* FEM?
* Integration!?!
* implicit TS


- normal python exercises? 
- io: memmapped io; create a non-rectangular hdf5 data like tetrahedral tesselation with a single scalar at
  each node with one dataset giving data points and another their coordinates (vertices of the etrahedra);
- vis: matplotlib animation
- shell: enough git to get them cloning the repo so they get the examples
